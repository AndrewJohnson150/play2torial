This project's purpose is for me to become familiar with the Play framework. The project itself is nothing special; it is a simple web app that allows you to type something in, and when you click a button the text will be displayed. The text is also stored in a MySQL database. This project uses Spring and Hibernate, and its main purpose is to help me understand how Play, Spring, MySQL, and Hibernate all work together. In addition, the application uses slf4j logging to keep track of the sequence of events in an organized fashion. 

To help understand validation, the text field must be between 3-20 characters, not containing leading or trailing whitespace. There can also be no duplicates.

This project was started with the following tutorial:
